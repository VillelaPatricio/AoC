Hey! I'm a 1st/2nd semester CS student, I'll try to do as many days as I possibly can of AoC, I know my code might be very very slopy but I'm happy cause I've been able to solve these puzzles on my own ;D

I'd really really really appreciate any comments/suggestions/commits to improve my code and in general my skills! Thankyou so much for coming here and taking the time to read this! ^^
